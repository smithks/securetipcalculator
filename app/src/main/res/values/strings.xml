    <string name="about_body">In short, palindrome tipping is the secure way to tip.
        \n\n
        When you pay for a meal
        using a credit card, there is an opportunity for anyone handling your receipt to commit fraud and modify your written tip
        and total amounts. The only way to combat this is to keep a receipt and then compare the charge once it posts to your account.
        \n\n
        Palindrome tipping offers a calculation method that will make noticing these fraudulent charges very easy.
        \n\n
        We calculate your total normally using your preferred tipping percentage and then apply the palindrome pattern. The pattern is simply
        mirroring the numbers in the ones and tens place and setting that mirrored amount on the right side of the decimal.

    </string>
    <string name="about_body2">Since we are altering the total we include a message telling you the actual tip percentage used.\n\nThe power of palindrome tipping lies in creating a pattern for your total that you will be able to instantly recognize when scanning
        your credit card statement.
        \n\n
        If you notice a charge to your credit card from a restaurant and it does not follow the palindrome pattern then you know
        that your intended total was altered.
    </string>

    <string name="limitations_header">Limitations</string>

    <string name="about_limitations">Due to each whole dollar value corresponding to a single palindrome pattern  ($3.00 = $3.30, $10.00 = $10.01, $134.00 = $134.43, etc..), at low
        amounts (usually less than $10), you can run into large amounts of rounding to reach a palindrome pattern that is greater than the original bill.
        \n\n
        Bill: $1.15 \n
        Tip at 17 percent: $0.20 \n
        Total: $1.35 \n
        \nTo make this total follow the palindrome pattern we would need to round the total up to $2.20 since rounding down to $1.10 would be less than the original bill.
        Rounding to a total of $2.20 would mean a 91 percent tip of $1.05! \n\n The pattern also does not work for any amount less than $1.00 because there is nothing to mirror ($0.23 mirrored is $0.00).
        In these cases you can switch to normal tipping from settings.
